## Hi there 👋
## About Me:
**I'm Sareena Javeria, an undergraduate student of Chemical Engineering at UET Peshawar . I'm passionate about learning and applying engineering principles to real-world problems, with interests in process optimization and sustainability.**
## Skills:
**Canva, MATLAB, RSM(Design Expert Software), AutoCad, Microsoft Office.**
## Project:
**Sedimentation Analysis of Marble and Chalk Particles**
- This project focuses on analyzing the sedimentation behavior of marble and chalk particles in fluid.
- Key aspects studied include:
  * Effect of particle size on settling velocity
  * Influence of particle density and fluid viscosity on sedimentation rates
  * Comparative analysis of marble vs. chalk particle settling characteristics
- A swdimentation tank was designed with optimized dimensions (height, diameter) for effective particle separation.
- The study aims to understand particle dynamics in industrial processes like water treatment, mineral processing and slurry transport.
